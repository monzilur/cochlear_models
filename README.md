Codes for producing cochleagrams using various cochlea models. These <br />
cochleagrams can used as inputs for encoding models of the auditory <br />
system.
# 
All functions that produce cochleagrams start with 'cochleagram_'. The  <br />
script file example_codes.m shows how to create both single fiber type  <br />
cochleagrams and multi-fiber type cochleagrams.
#
Each folder contains various dependencies of the models.
